Hi, welcome to Tingyi Lu's repo!
I'm passionate about Data Science & programming and have built up my data analytical skills via years of experience and myriads of projects both collaboratively with others and individually. 
I'm currently actively seeking for internships in Fall 2021 as a data scientist or business analyst intern as well as full-time positions starting in Spring 2022. 
Feel free to reach me via my email: tl3025@columbia.edu!
